                <p><strong>HYPERTEXT & NET ART:  Corey Pressman, Exprima Talks: Reading Hypertext with Mark Bernstein, February 27th 2014. </strong> <br>
<br>
This week’s reading of the interview with Mark Bernstein on hypertext felt like finding a map for a journey I did not realize I had started . I have always intuitively clicked through links, but hearing Bernstein describe the link as “the most important new form of punctuation since the comma” was a revelation . He is right, it fundamentally changes the contract between author and reader, moving us from a linear, authoritative monologue to a collaborative, exploratory dialogue. His comment that blue links were “a mistake” made me smile and re-evaluate every hyperlink I have ever designed or followed; it highlights how early design choices can calcify into invisible conventions that limit a medium’s potential . 

Bernstein’s critique of the anxiety around digital reading also resonated deeply. When he argues that complaints about shortened attention spans often reflect the “distraction” of the middle-aged critics themselves, I saw a reflection of my own internal debates . It is a powerful reminder that new forms of media are not destroying depth but are creating new kinds of literacy and narrative immersion.

<br><strong>Creative Spark </strong><br>

The concept of “guard fields” in Storyspace (rules that conditionally enable or disable links based on a reader’s path) ignited my imagination for a final project idea . What if a narrative could organically reshape itself based on a reader’s emotional responses or physical context (like time of day or location), rather than just their explicit choices? This is not about hiding content but about creating a more responsive and intimate story structure. I am fascinated by the challenge of balancing authorial intent with user agency, moving beyond simple branching paths to something more organic and adaptive. My first conceptual sketch is a network of short poetic fragments where the navigable pathways between them shift based on the tempo or theme of the fragments the reader has lingered on longest. </p>

                <p><strong>WEB 2.0 & SOCIAL MEDIA: Tim O’Reilly, What Is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, Sept 2005 </strong><br>
                <br>Tim O’Reilly’s foundational 2005 essay on Web 2.0 was like reading the optimistic blueprint for the social internet I grew up with . His principles:“harnessing collective intelligence,” “the web as platform,” and “rich user experiences”; clearly charted the shift from static, read-only web pages (Web 1.0) to the dynamic, participatory ecosystems we now inhabit . Seeing the early excitement around wikis, tagging, and user-generated content (contrasting Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikipedia, or Ofoto with Flickr) is both nostalgic and alarming. 

The alarming part comes from the gap between the ideal and the reality. As the 2006 Pew Research analysis pointed out, these principles do not always map cleanly onto real-world applications . For example, while users collectively build value on platforms like Google or Facebook, they do not have true “control over their own data” . The critique that Web 2.0 can be a “big, vague, nebulous cloud of pure architectural nothingness” feels more prescient now than ever . The business models which often built on advertising, data extraction, and network effects—have frequently turned participation into a product. I am left contemplating whether the core ethic of collaboration was ever truly separable from the capitalist framework that propelled its growth. 
<br>
<br><strong>Creative Spark  </strong><br>

This tension makes me want to create a project that embodies the principles of Web 2.0 (collaboration, user-as-contributor) while consciously subverting its dominant business models. My idea is a collaborative, ever-growing digital “zine” or sketchbook where contributions are explicitly not tracked for data, not used to build a profile, and not monetized. The only “value” is the communal artifact itself. It would use simple, open web tools to let anyone add a drawing, a line of text, or a sound. The challenge would be designing an interface that fosters meaningful contribution without the gamified hooks of likes, leaderboards, or personal branding. </p>

                <p><strong>CROWD SOURCING:  Aaron Koblin The Sheep Market (2006)</strong> <br>
                <br> Aaron Koblin’s The Sheep Market is a perfectly concise and powerful piece of conceptual art that embodies so many themes of our digital age . By using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to pay 10,000 workers two cents each to “draw a sheep facing to the left,” Koblin holds up a mirror to the hidden mechanics of crowdsourced labor . The project masterfully highlights the contradiction at the heart of platforms like Mechanical Turk: they reduce human creativity and effort to discrete, mechanical tasks (the name itself references a chess-playing automaton that hid a human inside), yet the output is 10,000 wildly unique sheep drawings, irrefutably proves the persistence of human uniqueness . 

Reading the analysis in Real Life Mag, I was struck by the connection to “minor literature” as defined by Deleuze and Guattari . Koblin’s work functions within the dominant “language” of a digital labor platform but uses it to “deterritorialize” that language, exposing its political and economic underpinnings. It is a form of institutional critique for the networked era. The project asks uncomfortable questions: Where do we draw the line between artistic commissioning and exploitative micro-labor? When we interact with seamless digital services, what invisible human effort are we relying on? 
<br>               
<br><strong>Creative Spark  </strong><br>
I am inspired to design a platform that inverts the typical crowdsourcing model. Instead of a central requester collecting and handing out tasks, it would be a cooperative space. The prompt would be an abstract, emotional question like “What does anticipation feel like in your body?” Participants could respond with a doodle, a color, a one-word text, or a recorded sound. The platform would then algorithmically weave these anonymous, micro-contributions into a dynamic, abstract visual and sonic tapestry. The goal is to create a portrait of a shared, yet personal, human experience, emphasizing collective expression over extracted labor.

                <p><strong>BOTS & CHAT: David Horvitz , The space between us 2015 </strong> <br>
              <br>  David Horvitz’s The space between us is a beautifully simple and profound intervention . In an age of global social networks, it creates a hyper-local, intimate, and resolutely physical connection. The app, which connects only two nearby phones, acting as a compass pointing each user to the other, is described as an “anti-social media” . This description is brilliant. It rejects the logic of accumulation (friends, followers, likes) in favor of a singular, embodied connection. As the article notes, it “reminds us of an intimacy based on physical proximity rather than virtual connectedness” by pointing away from the screen and into the shared physical space. 

This work sparked a key realization for me: so much of our networked communication is about overcoming distance, which is miraculous. But in doing so, we often neglect or devalue the specific qualities of co-presence—the shared environment, the unspoken body language, the mutual awareness of a place. Horvitz’s app does not just connect people; it makes the space between them the active subject of the work. It highlights distance and proximity as felt experiences.

This has me thinking about bots and presence in a new way. Most chat bots are designed to simulate human conversation to serve a function (customer service, companionship). What about a bot designed to pull you out of the digital and into the physical? My idea is a “Context Bot.” You could text it your vague feeling or intention (e.g., “feel calm,” “find something surprising,” “waste 10 minutes”). The bot, using local data (public APIs, weather, time), would not reply with text, but would generate a simple, poetic instruction for an action in your immediate surroundings. For example: “Find the nearest red object and look at it for one minute.” or “Go to a window and listen for a sound you normally filter out.” The art is in the prompt, and the experience is created by the user in their own space, re-enchanting the mundane physical world through a digital nudge.

                <p><strong>DATA & COLLECTION: Manovich, L. Database as a genre of new media. AI & Soc 14, 176–183 (2000).</strong> <br>
               <br> Lev Manovich’s argument that the database has become a key cultural form of the computer age is a lens through which I now see everything online. From my music library and photo roll to Wikipedia and social media feeds, we are constantly navigating and creating collections of items (records) sorted, filtered, and searched. Manovich’s crucial point is the inherent tension between the database (structured collection) and the narrative (cause-and-effect trajectory) . The database represents the world as a list of unordered items, while narrative imposes a particular logic and sequence onto those items. 

This explains so much about contemporary digital experiences. An Instagram profile is a database of images; the narrative (the “story” of a life) is something the viewer constructs by scanning and interpreting that collection. A Spotify playlist is a database of songs; the narrative arc of a listening session is a subjective experience. In interactive narratives (like games or hypertext), this tension is the core creative material: the author creates the database (characters, locations, events, text fragments), and the user’s choices generate a unique narrative sequence from it. The artist’s role shifts from sole storyteller to a designer of potential story-spaces.

                <p><strong>AI & MORE:  Refik Anadol: Space In the Mind of a Machine </strong> <br>
                <br>Refik Anadol’s work, like Machine Hallucinations, presents a breathtaking but deeply ambiguous future for art. Using machine learning algorithms on massive datasets (e.g., images of a city, architectural plans), he generates immersive, fluid visual experiences that feel both familiar and alien. The work is often described as allowing us to see “space in the mind of a machine.” This framing is potent. It positions AI not just as a tool but as a perceptual collaborator with its own “mind” or latent space. 

This forces me to confront critical questions. If the artwork is the product of an AI trained in the entirety of a city’s visual history, who is the author? Is it Anadol (the curator of data and trainer of models), the collective source of the data (the city and its inhabitants), or the AI itself? What does “creativity” or “expression” mean when the primary agent is a statistical model finding patterns in vast datasets? Anadol’s work feels less about individual human expression and more about visualizing collective memories and patterns invisible to the human eye. It is sublime, but it also evokes a certain melancholy, a potential loss of the intimate, subjective “hand” of the artist.
