## MOTIVATIONS & CONCEPT

The fundamental motivation behind Artisan Network stems from a desire to reclaim the communal nature of creativity in digital spaces. In traditional craft workshops, artists work alongside one another, observe techniques, draw inspiration from peers, and contribute to a shared creative environment. This organic exchange of ideas and the visible accumulation of collective work creates a sense of community and mutual inspiration that is largely absent from most digital creative tools. Applications like Photoshop, Procreate, or even browser-based drawing tools are inherently isolating experiences—you create alone, save locally, and your work exists in a vacuum unless you actively choose to share it on social media platforms not designed for creative collaboration.

I was particularly inspired by observing how maker spaces and community art studios function. When you walk into such a space, you see works-in-progress, finished pieces on display, and evidence of others' creative journeys. This visibility has a dual effect: it validates your own creative impulses ("others are making things too") and provides immediate inspiration through exposure to diverse styles, techniques, and subject matters. I wanted to translate this physical-space dynamic into a web application where the act of creating is inherently social, where saving your work automatically contributes to a community gallery, and where browsing others' creations is as natural as looking around a shared studio.

The choice to focus on three specific craft modalities—product painting, flower arranging, and charm bracelet design—was deliberate. These activities are accessible (requiring no specialized artistic training), personally expressive (allowing for individual style), and visually diverse (creating an interesting gallery when combined). Each workshop type also presented different technical challenges: product painting required real-time drawing with p5.js, flower arranging needed drag-and-drop positioning and layering, and charm bracelet design demanded dynamic SVG manipulation. This variety demonstrates the versatility of web technologies while maintaining thematic cohesion around the concept of craftsmanship and personal creation.

The project's title, "Artisan Network," deliberately invokes both traditional craftsmanship and modern digital connectivity. An artisan creates with skill and personal touch; a network connects individuals into a larger whole. The platform serves as a bridge between these concepts—your individual creation (artisan) becomes part of a collective experience (network). This duality extends to the technical implementation: individual user sessions and personal creative choices are stored as discrete database documents, yet the gallery aggregates all contributions into a unified community visualization.

## INTENTIONS & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

My primary intention was to create a web application that makes creativity inherently collaborative without requiring explicit collaboration. Unlike platforms that focus on multi-user real-time editing or formal project teams, Artisan Network operates on passive collaboration—you create independently, but your work immediately joins a shared cultural space where others can view, appreciate, and draw inspiration. This reflects how creativity actually functions in many contexts: artists influence each other not through direct cooperation but through exposure to each other's output.

The design philosophy centered on accessibility and warmth. I deliberately chose a light, bright color palette (warm coral, soft teal, sunny yellow) rather than the dark themes common in creative applications. This choice was aesthetic but also psychological—light themes feel more open, approachable, and less intimidating for casual users. The interface deliberately avoids technical terminology; there are no "layers" or "opacity" controls, just simple, clear labels like "Brush Size" and "Add Flower." This simplification was intentional: the goal is to lower barriers to entry, making creative expression accessible to users regardless of technical proficiency or artistic background.

The decision to implement simple name-based authentication (no passwords, no email verification, no account complexity) was controversial but intentional. For an educational project demonstrating database interaction and collaborative features, adding OAuth or secure password hashing would introduce unnecessary complexity that doesn't serve the core learning objectives. More importantly, it keeps the creative flow uninterrupted—a user visiting the site can enter a name and start creating within seconds. This frictionless onboarding is crucial for maintaining engagement in a platform where the primary value proposition is creative expression, not social networking or content consumption.

Each workshop's interaction model was designed to feel natural and intuitive. Product painting uses continuous drawing with a mouse or touch input, mimicking how one would paint on an actual object. Flower arranging uses click-to-add and drag-to-position, reflecting how physical flower arrangement works (picking stems and placing them). Charm bracelet design uses click-to-add charms that automatically position along a curved band, simplifying what would be a complex spatial arrangement task. These interaction models prioritize user agency (you control exactly where things go) while providing enough structure (automatic curve positioning, pre-made assets) that users don't face blank-canvas paralysis.

The gallery represents the culmination of the collaborative concept. Rather than treating it as an afterthought (a simple archive of saved work), the gallery is the primary manifestation of the platform's networked nature. Every creation appears here, sorted and filterable but fundamentally democratic—there's no algorithmic ranking, no "featured" content, no promotion mechanics. The most recent creation from a first-time user appears alongside work from returning users. This equality reflects the project's philosophy: all creative expression has inherent value, and the community is enriched by diversity of contributions rather than hierarchy of skill.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & RESOURCES

The application's architecture follows a traditional client-server model with modern asynchronous communication patterns. The backend is built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. Flask handles routing, session management, and serves Jinja2-templated HTML pages. The decision to use server-side rendering rather than a single-page application framework (React, Vue) was pragmatic—it reduces complexity, ensures better initial load performance, and leverages Flask's templating strengths. The only client-side routing is handled through traditional hyperlinks and form submissions.

Data persistence uses MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. MongoDB was chosen over relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for several reasons: its flexible schema accommodates the varying metadata across different workshop types (paintings have color palettes and stroke counts; arrangements have flower counts and vessel types), its JSON-like document structure aligns naturally with JavaScript objects transmitted via API calls, and Atlas provides a free tier suitable for educational projects. The database structure uses separate collections for each workshop type (paintings, arrangements, bracelets) plus a users collection, allowing workshop-specific queries while maintaining the ability to aggregate across all creations for the unified gallery.

The frontend employs vanilla JavaScript with the Fetch API for asynchronous communication, deliberately avoiding jQuery or larger frameworks. This choice was pedagogical—understanding raw JavaScript and the Fetch API demonstrates core web development concepts without framework-specific abstractions. Each workshop's JavaScript file is modular and self-contained, handling only that workshop's logic. The product painting workshop uses p5.js, a creative coding library that simplifies canvas manipulation, providing intuitive drawing functions and automatic touch/mouse event handling. P5.js was chosen over raw Canvas API because it reduces boilerplate code while maintaining low-level control over drawing operations.

The flower arranging workshop uses HTML5 drag-and-drop APIs combined with absolute positioning, demonstrating DOM manipulation and event handling without external libraries. Elements are dynamically created and positioned, with CSS transforms handling scaling and rotation. The charm bracelet workshop uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to render a curved bracelet band with positioned charms, showcasing vector graphics manipulation in web contexts. SVG was particularly appropriate here because it maintains visual quality at any zoom level and can be easily serialized to PNG for database storage.

CSS architecture uses CSS custom properties (variables) for the design system, ensuring consistent colors, spacing, and typography across all pages. The stylesheet is organized by component (navigation, buttons, forms) and by page (home, workshops, gallery), with clear comments delineating sections. Responsive design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, with media queries handling mobile breakpoints. The design prioritizes readability and touch-friendly interaction areas on smaller screens.

Key technical resources consulted during development included the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for JavaScript and Web API documentation, the p5.js reference guide for canvas drawing methods, the Flask documentation for routing and session management, and the MongoDB documentation for query syntax and aggregation pipelines. Stack Overflow was consulted for specific implementation challenges, particularly around converting canvas elements to Base64 strings and handling file uploads for custom flowers and charms.

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES & IMPACT

The primary expected outcome is a functional web application demonstrating full-stack development competencies: frontend UI/UX design, client-side JavaScript programming with asynchronous API calls, server-side routing and business logic, and database integration with CRUD operations. The application should successfully allow multiple users to create content in three different workshops, save that content to a MongoDB database, and view an aggregated gallery of all users' creations with filtering and sorting capabilities.

From a user experience perspective, the expected outcome is that any visitor, regardless of technical or artistic background, can understand the platform's purpose within seconds of landing on the home page, navigate to a workshop within one click, create something personally meaningful within minutes, and feel motivated to browse the gallery to see others' work. The simplicity of the name-based authentication should make the barrier to participation trivial, while the visual appeal of the light theme and polished interface should create a sense of quality and care that encourages engagement.

Technically, the application demonstrates mastery of several key web development concepts: asynchronous JavaScript with Promises and async/await syntax, RESTful API design with meaningful endpoints, database schema design for NoSQL document stores, session-based authentication, dynamic DOM manipulation, event-driven programming paradigms, responsive CSS design, and integration of third-party libraries (p5.js). Each of these concepts is implemented not as an isolated technical exercise but in service of a cohesive user experience and clear conceptual framework.

The collaborative aspect is the project's most significant expected outcome. Unlike static websites or simple CRUD applications, Artisan Network creates a living system where user contributions accumulate over time, forming an emergent creative ecosystem. Each new creation enriches the gallery, providing inspiration for future users, who in turn contribute their own work, continuing the cycle. This demonstrates the power of networked applications: the platform's value increases with use, and the whole (the community gallery) becomes greater than the sum of its parts (individual creations).

From a critical perspective, the project also raises questions about digital creativity and ownership in networked spaces. By making all creations immediately public and attributable only by username (not tied to verified identities or email addresses), the platform creates a peculiar creative commons—your work is yours in that it's attributed to your chosen name, but anyone can view it, draw inspiration from it, or potentially copy techniques. This reflects broader tensions in digital creative spaces between openness and control, inspiration and appropriation, community and individual ownership.

The expected pedagogical outcome is demonstrating competency with the CART 351 course objectives: understanding client-server architecture, implementing database-driven applications, creating interactive user interfaces with JavaScript, and integrating multiple web technologies into a cohesive project. The written documentation and in-person demonstration serve as evidence of not just technical implementation but also conceptual understanding—the ability to articulate motivations, design decisions, and technical challenges demonstrates metacognitive awareness of the development process.

Ultimately, Artisan Network is an argument in code form: creativity is inherently social, digital tools can foster genuine community, and web applications can create experiences that are greater than the sum of their technical components. Whether evaluated as a technical artifact, a design exercise, or a conceptual exploration of networked creativity, the project succeeds by demonstrating that thoughtful implementation of web technologies can create meaningful, engaging user experiences that bring people together through shared creative expression.
